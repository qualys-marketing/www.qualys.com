# Eleventy (11ty) Starter Site
A basic starter site for creating eleventy static websites. The live starter site is at https://my11tywebsite.netlify.app/.

This starter site has example files and code to demonstrate some 11ty features including:
* layout inheritance
* block functionality using shortcodes
* dumping all global and local data to a page for easy debugging
* draft mode using permalink:false in the front matter

The source (input) folder is "src" and the build (output) folder is "www". 

All templates are Nunjucks (.njk) templates because I prefer it over all other templating engines.

This starter site includes HTML5 boilerplate.

Clone this repo and delete the example code you don't need.
